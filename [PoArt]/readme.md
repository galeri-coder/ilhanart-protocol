# 🎨 [PoArt] Proof of Art Protocol v1.0
> **"Seal the process, not just the pixels. Honor the will, not the algorithm."**

[PoArt] is a decentralized digital notary protocol designed to verify, protect, and eternalize **human effort and the artistic creation process** in an era where Generative AI can produce visual output in seconds.

## 🏛️ Philosophy & Purpose

Today, the value of a piece of art can no longer be determined solely by "what it looks like." Artificial Intelligence can generate flawless results without human soul or struggle. This shift threatens the most fundamental value of art: the **time and human will** invested by the creator.

**The Mission of [PoArt] is to:**
* **Certify Labor:** Redefine art not as a final static file, but as a "cumulative expenditure of time."
* **Process-Oriented Validation:** Turn every second—from the first brushstroke to the final touch—into technical evidence.
* **The AI Barrier:** Prove that the human will—complete with its unique decisions, risks, and even beautiful mistakes—is inimitable.
* **The 3000 Archive:** Secure an artist's legacy through mathematical certainty, independent of central authorities.

## 📦 The Evidence Pack

To achieve [PoArt] status, an artist does not simply upload a finished work. They provide an **Evidence Pack**—the unique "DNA" of the creation process.

1.  **Process Timelapse:** A continuous, high-speed recording showing every stage of production from a blank canvas to completion.
2.  **Live Logs:** Technical metadata and timestamps captured during the actual creation hours.
3.  **Technical Fingerprint:** Details regarding tools, brush dynamics, and layers, signed with the artist's digital key.
4.  **Capture Manifest:** A cryptographically secured index of all files in the pack, ensuring nothing is added or removed.

## 🔐 Technical Integrity & Digital Notary

[PoArt] replaces "subjective approval" with unbreakable mathematical algorithms.

### SHA-512 Integrity Seal
The protocol utilizes the **SHA-512** hashing algorithm to seal every Evidence Pack. We chose SHA-512 for its high collision resistance and long-term security margin (post-quantum readiness), aligning with our **2026–3000** vision.

* **EvidenceRoot:** A Merkle Root generated from the hashes of every file in the Evidence Pack.
* **NotarySeal:** The final "Seal of Truth" generated by the Digital Notary system.

$$\text{NotarySeal} = \text{SHA-512}(\text{EvidenceRoot} \mid \text{SignerSignature} \mid \text{TimeStamp})$$

Once this seal is applied, the record is immutable. Even a single bit of change in the evidence files will invalidate the entire Notary Seal.

## 📜 Public Registry (The Archive)

Once verified, every [PoArt] record is etched into the **Public Registry**. This registry is:
* **Transparent:** Anyone can audit the evidence behind the art.
* **Immutable:** Records cannot be manipulated or deleted once the Notary Seal is applied.
* **Eternal:** The technical proof of creation lives on in the digital archive, even if the physical creator is no longer present.

## 🛠️ The State Machine (Record Lifecycle)

Every [PoArt] entry progresses through a deterministic lifecycle:
1.  **Draft:** The artist compiles evidence and metadata.
2.  **Submitted:** The Evidence Pack is uploaded for verification.
3.  **Under Review:** The system performs SHA-512 integrity checks and technical audits.
4.  **Verified:** The Notary Seal is issued and the record is locked in the Public Registry.
5.  **Legacy:** A historically preserved record, archived for future generations.

## ✨ Conclusion: Saving the Future of Art

[PoArt] shifts the value of art away from market speculation and back to where it belongs: **the artist’s labor.** It is a blueprint for a future where evidence beats deception, and a thousand years of vision outweighs a second of automation.
